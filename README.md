# üõ°Ô∏è Scanning with Nmap

## Setup and Prerequisites

1. Install VirtualBox:

Download and install VirtualBox on your machine.
Create virtual machines for both Kali Linux (attacker machine) and Metasploitable 2 (vulnerable target).

2. Set Up Metasploitable2:

Download and install Metasploitable2 from the official repository.
Ensure that both the Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2 VMs are on the same network (NAT or host-only network) so that they can communicate.

3. Set Up Kali Linux:

Download Kali Linux from the official website and install it on VirtualBox.
Update the system by running the following commands:

<pre>   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  </pre>

## Scanning with Nmap
Once your setup is complete, you can use Nmap from the Kali Linux machine to scan the Metasploitable2 machine.

1. **Find the Metasploitable2 IP Address:**

Start Metasploitable2 in VirtualBox.
Run the following command inside the Metasploitable2 virtual mach ine to find the IP address:

<pre>  ifgonfig  </pre>

- Look for the IP under the inet addr section for eth0 (typically something like 192.168.x.x).

2. **Nmap Scan on Kali Linux:**

In Kali Linux, open a terminal and run an Nmap scan targeting Metasploitable 2‚Äôs IP address. You can use different scan types depending on what you want to demonstrate.
Here are a few examples:

- Basic scan (find open ports):
